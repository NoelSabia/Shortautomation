## Preflight Check List

### How to Install Python
1. Visit the official Python website or use your package manager.  
2. Verify installation with:  
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```


### How to Set Up a Virtual Environment
1. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv &&
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```



### How and What to Install via pip
1. Ensure youâ€™re in the virtual environment.  
2. Install dependencies and ffmpeg on your system:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### How and What to Install via apt and git
Just to adress the elephant in the room wmctrl is a command_line tool that controls windos.
This in combination with feh, an image viewer, opens the possiblity to don't lose focus on the terminal and still be able to view every image and video.
The same combination just with mpv instead of feh is used for videos.
FFMPEG is then used for the fusion of the short and in some parts for the audio.
For that install:
```bash
   sudo apt install wmctrl feh mpv ffmpeg -y

   #Then inside of the project Shortautomization in subtitles_gathering clone openai-whisper with http or ssh
   cd subtitles_gathering

   #ssh
   git clone org-14957082@github.com:openai/whisper.git

   #http
   git clone https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
```

### API Keys and How to Get Them
1. Sign up for the necessary APIs (Eleven Labs, OpenAI).  
2. Add the keys to your .env file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ELEVEN_LABS_API_X=your_elevenlabs_key
   ```
> [!TIP]
> You can use a 10-min-mail to create endless free eleven labs api-keys. The more the better. ðŸ˜‰


### How to get the JSONs to autoupload youtube shorts
1. You need a Google account to upload to YouTube (https://www.google.com/intl/de/account/about/)
2. Go to: console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager
3. Check that you use the correct Google account
4. Click on "Create Project", give it a name and then click on create
5. Click on the Pop-Up on the top right that says: "Select Project"
6. Hover over "APIs & Services" and then click on "Enable APIs & services"

12. Go to "Audience" and click on "Add Users" and add your mail
13. Go to "Clients" click on "Create Client" and select "Web Application"
14. Create URI1 and URI2 with http://localhost:8080/ and http://localhost:8080/oauth2callback and click on create
15. Now Download the JSON and your ready to go


## How to Use This Command-Line Program
1. Activate your virtual environment.
2. Run Python scripts from the terminal, for example:  
   ```bash
   python3 main.py <directory of where to write the output> <from here on only args are websites to scrape> ...
   ```
3. Follow the prompts.


## How to Use the Master Command-Line Program
1. Activate your virtual environment.
2. Change the file program_args.txt [accordingly](#how-to-change-the-program-args-file-correctly) or leave the default values.
3. Run Python scripts from the terminal, for example:  
   ```bash
   python3 master.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts.

> [!NOTE]
> You will only need the master command-line program if you want to create multiple videos in one go.

### How to change the program args file correctly
The program_args.txt file has blocks that will have one directory of where to save all the output and as many websites to scrape as you want. It takes these parameters:

1. dir=<value in form of a string> -> this key-pair value shows where all the output will be downloaded (recommended "~/Documents/<projectname>)
2. browser=<value in form of a str> -> this key-pair value should either be chrome or firefox everything else is not supported
3. youtube_german=<value in form of a str> -> this key-pair value is for uploads to the german channel
4. youtube_english=<value in form of a str> -> this key-pair value is for uploads to the english channel
5. website=<value in form of a str> -> this key-pair value gives the website to scrape. You can have as many website key-value pairs as you like

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The only problem is that if you don't use the default websites you have to write your own python code to scrape.
